Bad Card Design Patterns to Avoid
1. The “Bigger Number” Card

(Most common, most dangerous)
Pattern
“Deal 12 damage.”
“Deal 16 damage.”
Why It’s Bad
No identity
No synergy
No decision-making

Power creep bait
Fix
Add:
A condition
A threshold
A timing hook
A resource interaction
✔ Better:
“Deal 8 damage. If you have 4+ Momentum, deal it again.”

2. Auto-Include Staples

(Kills build diversity)
Pattern
Low cost
Always useful
No downside
Fits every deck
Why It’s Bad
Reduces deck identity
Makes future cards harder to design
Becomes invisible tech tax
Red Flags
“Draw 2 cards”
“Gain 10 Block”
“Deal damage and draw”
Fix
Tie value to a mechanic
Add a play condition
Require setup or sequencing

3. Fake Choices

(Illusion of depth)

Pattern
“Choose A or B”
…but one option is almost always better.
Why It’s Bad
Teaches players to ignore text
Undermines trust in the system
Fix
Make the choice context-sensitive:
A = short-term
B = long-term
Or different archetypes

4. Everything Card
(Overloaded design)
Pattern
Damage
Block
Draw
Status
Buff
All on one card.
Why It’s Bad
Obsoletes other cards
Hard to balance
Removes sequencing choices
Fix
Pick one primary function
Push other effects into thresholds or follow-ups
Rule:
If it answers every problem, it’s the problem.

5. Pure Punishment Without Payoff

(Feels unfair, not risky)
Pattern
Lose HP
Lose cards
Lose resources
…with no satisfying return.
Why It’s Bad
Players avoid it
Risk feels mandatory, not optional
Fix
Every self-punish mechanic must:
Enable power
Create tension
Offer control
✔ Good risk:
Lose HP → gain scaling damage
❌ Bad risk:
Lose HP → slightly better damage

6. Invisible Synergy
(The “why does this work?” problem)
Pattern
Card synergizes, but nothing in text explains why
Why It’s Bad
Requires wiki knowledge
Frustrates new players
Makes builds feel accidental
Fix
Explicit keywords
Clear thresholds
On-card reminders
Players should discover combos, not decode them.

7. Threshold Bloat

(Too many breakpoints)

Pattern
3 Momentum → X
5 Momentum → Y
7 Momentum → Z
9 Momentum → W

Why It’s Bad
Hard to read
Hard to remember
Hard to balance
Fix
1–2 thresholds per card
Make them meaningful
Use consistent numbers across the system

8. Mandatory Setup Cards

(Deck tax cards)
Pattern
Card does nothing alone
Required to “turn on” other cards
Why It’s Bad
Dead draws
Feels like punishment
Reduces card pool freedom
Fix
Setup cards should do something on their own
Or scale when combined, not require it

9. Delayed Without Interaction

(Feels unresponsive)
Pattern
Play card
Nothing happens
Wait
Why It’s Bad
Player disengagement
Feels like lost tempo

Fix
Delayed effects should:
Show intent
Be modifiable
Be interactable (Preparation, thresholds, buffs)

10. One-Answer Meta Cards
(Solves too much)
Pattern
“Remove all enemy buffs.”
“Negate all damage this turn.”
Why It’s Bad
Invalidates encounter design
Forces enemy escalation
Creates arms race
Fix
Partial answers
Conditional answers
Costs tied to state
11. Scaling Without Ceiling

(Breaks late game)
Pattern
“Gain +X every time Y happens”
No cap, no decay
Why It’s Bad
Runaway power
Balance nightmares
Invalidates content
Fix
Caps
Diminishing returns
Conditional resets

12. Redundant Cards
(Bloats the pool)
Pattern
Same effect
Slightly different numbers
Same cost
Why It’s Bad
Dilutes rewards
Makes drops boring
Fix
If two cards exist, they must:
Play differently
Scale differently
Reward different builds

13. Ascendancy Hijackers
(Break class identity)
Pattern
A single card that fully replaces an ascendancy mechanic
Why It’s Bad
Makes class choice irrelevant
Devalues progression
Fix
Cards should enhance ascendancies, not replace them

14. UI-Hostile Text
(Cognitive overload)
Pattern
Long paragraphs
Nested conditions
Too many keywords
Why It’s Bad
Slows play
Hurts readability
Fix
Short lines
Clear structure
Use icons & thresholds

15. “Solved on Play” Cards

(No mastery curve)
Pattern
Card’s best use is obvious
No improvement over time

Why It’s Bad
Short lifespan
No skill expression

Fix
Add timing nuance
Add sequencing depth
Add build-dependent value
The Golden Anti-Pattern Rule
If a card removes more decisions than it creates, it is dangerous.
