1. Greeting (First-Time)

Seer:
“Ah… a new presence in the weave.
Your steps disturb the drifting fragments — the Law notices you.”

“You carry some Forms, but the world will try to offer you more.
With the right structure, I can help them settle.”

(she glances at the glowing orb beside her)

“If you find an Orb of Generation, bring it to me.
With it, I can coax a fragment into… a usable card.”

Player dialogue options unlock after this line.

2. Dialogue Options (After Greeting)
→ Who are you?

Seer:
“I am called the Seer because I no longer see as others do.
The Shattering took my sight… and replaced it with something else.”

“I see threads.
Fractures.
Echoes of the Law trying to rebuild itself.”

“I was once an Observer, one of the last students of the Vassaran sealwrights.
My task was never to carve meaning — only to watch where meaning wavered.”

→ What happened to you?

Seer:
“When the Concord broke, the world screamed.
Most heard nothing. A few felt the tremor.
But I… I saw the Law split.”

“It burned through my eyes, tore them open to everything beneath the surface.
Since then, light means nothing to me.
Only structure… and the places where structure fails.”

“But in that failure, fragments drift.
And fragments can be shaped — with the right tools.”

(She gestures to her crystal sphere.)
“Which is why I remain here.”

→ Orbs of Generation?

Seer:
“They’re not truly orbs in the old sense.
They’re cores of order.”

“Condensed stability.
Lattices strong enough to hold a fragment of the Law still long enough for me to shape it.”

“Without them, the fragments slip away again… forgotten.”

“If you bring me one, I can stabilize whatever the Law is trying to rebuild.
A card, a Form — a memory of how things once functioned.”

→ How does card creation work? (Tutorial)

Seer:
“Come closer. Watch the mist inside the sphere.”

“The Law sends out fragments — half-memory, half-intention.
Most drift endlessly. But I can guide them.”

“I use the Orb to coax a fragment into clarity.
The Orb of Generation provides the structure.
Together, they form something stable: a card.”

“You will not control what emerges.
The Law remembers what it chooses.”

“But every card is a piece of the world’s forgotten order…
and a weapon against its unmaking.”

→ Could I see some of your cards? (Vendor)

Seer:
“Of course.
Stabilized Forms linger after creation — until someone claims them.”

“Look through them.
Choose carefully.
Some fragments still carry echoes of their old purpose… and their old dangers.”
