1. Archetype Identity (Required)

☐ Does this card clearly belong to one primary archetype bucket?
(Tempo / Burst / Engine / Control / Attrition / Defense / Utility)

☐ If it is a hybrid, is the secondary archetype intentional and obvious?
☐ Can you describe the card’s purpose in one sentence?

“This is a Momentum spender for AoE clears.”
“This is a Guard engine that punishes multi-hit enemies.”

❌ If the answer is “It just does damage / block / draw”, it’s not finished.

2. Build Motivation (Required)

☐ Would a player ever say:
“This card would be amazing if I also ran X”?
☐ Does the card reward an existing mechanic?
Momentum
Preparation
Delay
Discard
Ailments
Guard
Spell/Attack sequencing

☐ Is there a clear reason to include this card beyond raw numbers?
❌ If the card is only good because of high base values, it will age badly.

3. Decision Tension (Very Important)

☐ Does playing this card involve a meaningful choice?
Spend now vs later
Setup vs payoff
Safety vs greed

☐ Is there a cost, risk, or opportunity loss?
Resource spend
Delayed effect
Conditional scaling
☐ Could this card be misplayed in a way that matters?
❌ Cards that are always correct to play immediately reduce skill expression.

4. Timing Interaction (Strongly Encouraged)

☐ Does the card care about when it’s played?
After a Spell
Before an Attack
With Momentum threshold
With Preparation charges
Next turn payoff (Delay)

☐ Does it interact with turn flow?
Front-loaded
Back-loaded
Reactive
Predictive

❌ Cards that ignore turn timing feel flat in a deckbuilder.

5. Synergy Hooks (At Least One)

The card should hook into at least one of the following:

☐ Status Effects
☐ Resource Thresholds
☐ Card Types (Attack / Spell / Guard / Power)
☐ Enemy State (Stunned, Vulnerable, Guarded)
☐ Player State (Momentum, Preparation, Low HP, Buffs)

Bonus if it has two hooks but only one primary.

6. Scaling & Progression Check

☐ Does this card scale naturally with:
Levels?
Stats (Str, Dex, Int)?
Build investment?

☐ Does it remain interesting at:
Early game
Mid game
End game

☐ Does it avoid being:
Auto-include forever
Completely obsolete later

❌ Flat cards with no scaling hooks die quickly.

7. Rarity Justification
☐ Does the card’s complexity match its rarity?

Common
Teaches a mechanic
Simple synergy

Low rules overhead
Magic
Clear specialization
Strong interaction

Moderate rules text
Rare
Build-defining

Multi-system interaction
High payoff or risk
❌ Rare cards that just “do more” are a red flag.

8. Visual & Thematic Readability
☐ Could an artist represent this card in one clear visual idea?

☐ Does the card fantasy match:
Its class?
Its ascendancy?
The world’s Law / Shattering theme?
☐ Would a player recognize what the card does just by the art name?
❌ Mechanics-first cards with no fantasy anchor feel gamey.

9. Anti-Bloat Check (Very Important)
☐ Does this card do too many things?
☐ Could two effects be:

Removed?
Moved to momentum/preparation thresholds?
Split into a different card?

☐ Is every line doing real work?
Rule of thumb:
One core idea, one twist.

10. “Would I Be Excited to See This Drop?” Test
Final gut check:

☐ Would I be happy to see this card from:
A boss?
A rare enemy?
The Seer’s Orb?

☐ Would this card make me:
Rethink my deck?
Adjust my route?
Change how I play turns?
❌ If the answer is “meh, it’s fine”, redesign it.

Optional Internal Tagging (Highly Recommended)
Internally tag each card with:
Primary Archetype
Secondary Archetype (optional)
Resource Interaction
Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
Complexity Tier

This will massively help:
Balance passes
Vendor pools
AI usage
Expansion design
Final Rule (Pin This)
A card should change how the player thinks, not just what number goes up.
