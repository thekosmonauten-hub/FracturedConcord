Blinket the Bargain Bound
“Ah! Customer! Or victim! Or… hm. No, customer. Yes. Blinket decides customer today.”

Player (Dialogue Options):

“Who are you?”

“What is this place?”

“Why does your bag keep… twitching?”

“Let me see what you’re selling.” (Opens shop)

*“Goodbye.”

If Player chooses: “Who are you?”

Blinket:
“Blinket, at your service! Purveyor of rare oddities, risky bargains, and whatever reality hasn’t swallowed yet today.
Blinket collects things that fall out of the Maze’s cracks! Sometimes they fall through him first, but Blinket doesn’t complain. Much.”

Player Options:

“Are you… from the Maze?”

“You seem… nervous.”

“Show me your wares.”

If Player chooses “Are you… from the Maze?”

Blinket:
“Oh no! Blinket would never live in there. Laws bend too much. Ankles break too easy. Blinket prefers the outside where sanity only occasionally slips away.”

If Player chooses “You seem… nervous.”

Blinket:
“Nervous? No no no. Blinket is cautiously optimistic. Many things want to eat Blinket, but Blinket has learned to wriggle just right.”

If Player chooses: “What is this place?”

Blinket:
“This? This is Blinket’s Ever-Shifting Emporium! A shop so dependable it only disappears twice a day! Sometimes more. Inventory restocks whenever reality sneezes. Blinket hates when it sneezes upwards.”

Player Options:

“Restocks? Without you doing anything?”

“Is it safe to shop here?”

“Can I just see what you’re selling?”

If “Restocks? Without you doing anything?”

Blinket:
“Oh yes! Blinket is blessed and cursed. Mostly cursed. The Laws near the Maze twist, tangle, knot! Items vanish, multiply, melt, or turn into coupons for things that don’t exist. Blinket makes do.”

If “Is it safe to shop here?”

Blinket:
“For Blinket? No.
For you? …Probably. Blinket recommends you don’t sniff anything, though.”

If Player chooses: “Why does your bag keep… twitching?”

Blinket:
“Ah! That means the merchandise is fresh. Or alive. Or angry. Hard to say! Blinket doesn’t open the bag unless a customer is looking—very important safety rule.”

⭐ If Player chooses: “Let me see what you’re selling.”

Blinket:
“Of course! Step right up. Browse quickly before the stock remembers it can leave!”

Blinket occasionally says ambient lines while you browse:

“Careful. That one bites.”

“Blinket is 80% sure that price is correct!”

“If you hear humming, don’t hum back.”

“Blinket accepts gold, shards, secrets, and polite begging.”

“No refunds! Not since the incident.”

If Player chooses: “Goodbye.”

Blinket:
“Blinket bids you farewell! Try not to die! Blinket’s best customers are the ones who keep coming back.”
