# 1. QUEST START: “Blinket’s Bad Day”

Location: Outside the Maze entrance

Interacting with Blinket on a specific day (or with a specific dialogue choice) triggers the quest.

Player:

“Blinket… you’re shaking. What happened?”

Blinket:

“Oh! Nothing! Everything! Blinket woke up missing three teeth — but they were teeth Blinket never had to begin with! Bad omen. Bad omen indeed. Means the coin has memory issues.
When it forgets, Blinket suffers.”

Player:

“The coin? Your Binding?”

Blinket:

“Not Blinket’s coin. Never Blinket’s. Blinket stole it—
no! Borrowed it! Found it.
Tripped over it.
Was chosen by it.
Yes, that one.
But if you find who owned it first, maybe coin remembers them instead of Blinket.”

He points trembling toward the old Vassaran road.

Blinket:

“Look for the ledger-stones. They hum like guilt.”

## 2. OBJECTIVE: FIND THE FIRST LEDGER-STONE

Location: A ruined Vassaran checkpoint

There is a cracked stone pillar humming faintly.

Interact: Ledger-Stone Fragment

“ACCOUNT OF TRADESMAN SILAS VELL”
“I have found a clause within the Concordial Law — a rule that governs equivalence. If rewritten, it could stabilize our empire's resources forever…”

The player hears a whisper — soft but unmistakably similar to Blinket’s Binding.

Silas Vell was the coin’s owner.

## 3. BACKTRACKING THE FORGOTTEN RITUAL

The player follows 2–3 optional exploration nodes (ruins, small encounters).

Second Ledger-Stone (in an abandoned camp):

“The rewriting will not be grand. I lack the power of the Sealwrights. But a single clause — a small one — might bend enough to give us a stable, fair exchange of life for life, value for value.”

“The coin is my ritual anchor… it speaks back now. That frightens me.”

Third Ledger-Stone (in a collapsed vault):

“I bartered with forces I did not understand. The coin took more than I offered.
It demanded obedience… then wrote it into me.”

Nearby is Silas’ corpse, preserved unnaturally, as if resisting decay.

When the player touches it, the Binding Coin hums in the player's inventory.

##4. RETURN TO BLINKET – “A Debt That Never Dies”
Player:

“I found the coin’s original owner. Silas Vell. He tried to rewrite a Law.”

Blinket goes unnaturally still.

Blinket:

“Silas… yes. The name burns in the Binding. He was first. Not last. Poor him.
He thought he controlled the coin. But trade must be equal.
Silas broke the rule. So the rule… broke him.”

Blinket clutches at his chest.

Blinket:

“If you found Silas, then something else stirs. The coin remembers its debt.
Debt always seeks a new collector.”

A corrupted construct materializes nearby — Silas’ Debt, a small boss encounter.

## 5. MINIBOSS: SILAS’ DEBT

A floating mass of broken runes, echoing voices of bargains undone.

Abilities

Interest Grows: Gains strength each turn the player doesn’t attack.
Equalized Loss: Mirrors the player’s highest damage card last round.
Debt Collector: Tries to drain max HP permanently (fails outside the Maze).

Upon defeating it, the construct breaks—and a small, glowing item remains.

## 6. QUEST REWARD: “Fragment of Original Clause”
Item Description:

A splinter of the Law Silas tried to change — a rule of equivalence. It vibrates with unresolved purpose.

Effect (Campaign):

Unlocks a unique clause for the player’s Warrant or Maze forging system:

Clause — “Equivalence Reforged”

Player can convert a card or warrant modifier into another modifier of equal rarity.

Once per run/session.

## 7. BLINKET EPILOGUE
Blinket:

“You found the first merchant who bargained with Law… and lost.
Blinket is the second.
But maybe you — yes, maybe you — will be third.
Third time’s lucky. Or very, very not.”

He smiles wide, too wide.

Blinket:
“Either way… Blinket will have excellent deals for you.”
