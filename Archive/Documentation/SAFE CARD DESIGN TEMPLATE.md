SAFE CARD DESIGN TEMPLATE

Use this template every time a new card is created.
If a card cannot cleanly fill this out, it’s a red flag.

1. Card Identity (Non-Negotiable)

Card Name:

Short, evocative, hints at function or condition.

Card Type:

Attack / Spell / Guard / Utility / Discard / Stack Spender / Hybrid

Element / Damage Type:

Physical / Fire / Cold / Lightning / Chaos / Mixed

Primary Role:

Pick one:

Damage

Defense

Setup

Payoff

Control

Engine

❗ If you can’t pick one → card is overloaded.

2. Core Action (What Happens Immediately)

On Play:

Describe the immediate, guaranteed effect.

Example:

“Deal 9 Physical damage.”

Rules:

Must do something alone

Must be readable in one line

Should never require another card to be useful

3. Build Hook (Why This Card Exists)

Conditional / Scaling Clause:

This is where the card becomes interesting.

Choose one or two max:

Resource threshold (Momentum, Guard, Preparation, Charges)

State check (Blocked last turn, Discarded, Shocked enemy)

Elemental interaction

Stack interaction

Timing interaction (per turn, delayed, next card)

Example:

“If you Blocked last turn, repeat this attack.”

❗ Avoid:

3+ conditions

Nested conditions

Hidden synergy

4. Risk / Cost / Tension (Mandatory)

Every strong card must create tension.

Pick at least one:

Resource spend (Guard, Reliance, Charges)

Delayed payoff

Self-debuff

Exhaust / Cooldown

Requires setup state

Position in turn order matters

Example:

“Consumes all Guard.”

This prevents:

Auto-includes

Power creep

Brain-off play

5. Scaling Vector (Future-Proofing)

How does this card scale?

Pick one primary scaling axis:

Flat damage (early game)

% scaling (mid game)

Conditional scaling (late game)

Synergy scaling (build-dependent)

Define:

What increases its value

What caps or limits it

Example:

“+3 damage per Guard consumed (max 15).”

6. Synergy Declaration (Explicit)

Synergizes With:

Keywords

Archetypes

Ascendancies

Other card types

Example:

“Synergizes with Guard, Spellwoven effects, and Retaliation builds.”

This prevents invisible combos and helps players build intentionally.

7. Anti-Abuse Check (Internal)

Answer yes/no:

❏ Does this replace another card’s role entirely?

❏ Is this always good in every deck?

❏ Does it remove decision-making?

❏ Does it scale infinitely?

❏ Does it solve multiple encounter problems alone?

If any = yes, revise.

8. Clarity Pass (UI & Readability)

Rules:

Max ~3 short text blocks

Thresholds use consistent numbers

Keywords over prose

Icons over adjectives

If it needs a tooltip explanation → simplify.

9. Example Card (Filled Template)

Name: Cracked Aegis
Type: Guard
Element: Physical
Primary Role: Defense

On Play:
Gain 12 Guard.

Build Hook:
If you played a Spell this turn, gain +6 Guard.

Risk / Cost:
Guard decays fully at end of turn.

Scaling Vector:
Scales with Spell frequency, not raw numbers.

Synergy:
Bladeweaver, Spellwoven, Guard triggers.

Anti-Abuse:
✔ Not an auto-include
✔ Requires sequencing
✔ No infinite scaling

10. “Should This Card Exist?” Final Gate

Before shipping, ask:

What deck becomes possible because this card exists?

If the answer is:

“All decks” → ❌

“None specifically” → ❌

“A distinct playstyle” → ✅
