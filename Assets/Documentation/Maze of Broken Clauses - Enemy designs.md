Maze of Broken Clauses - Enemy designs

🜁 LAW CONSTRUCTS (1–5)

Entities made from fractured Concordial script, broken geometry, or half-working enforcement routines.

1. Mandate Fragmenter

A drifting mass of broken stone segments held together by glowing law-runes.
Behavior: Slow, heavy hits. Debuffs the player’s next turn.
Abilities:
Clause Slam — Deals damage and increases the cost of the next card played.
Runic Weight — Applies a stacking effect where your deck temporarily gains “Heavy” status (reduced draw or slower cycling).
Sentence Lock — If the fight goes long, it disables one random card for a turn.

Quirk:
Sometimes pauses mid-animation as if “waiting for an instruction that no longer exists.”

2. Law-Tethered Sentinel
A humanoid statue held upright by cords of radiant text that hum softly.
Behavior: Guard/defense-based.
Abilities:
Interdict Barrier — Creates a shield that reflects a portion of damage.
Wordbind — Places a mark on the player: next attack card played deals less damage.
Restore Protocol — Occasionally repairs itself (minor heal).

Quirk:
Flickering text occasionally whispers old legal language from the Empire of Vassara.

3. Null-Geometry Hound
An angular beast of floating polyhedrons, like a wolf built from broken geometry.

Behavior: Fast and chaotic.
Abilities:
Sidestep Reality — Gains Evasion; your next attack has a 50% chance to miss.
Fractured Pounce — Teleports before attacking, dealing unpredictable damage.
Entropic Bite — Inflicts a DoT that grows each turn if not cleansed.
Quirk:
Leaves no footprints—its feet momentarily phase through the floor.

4. Compliance Warden
A towering construct shaped like a judge’s gavel fused with an armored golem.
Behavior: Punishes repeated card types.
Abilities:
Pattern Violation — If the player uses the same card type twice in a row, the Warden deals bonus retaliation damage.
Edict Crush — Heavy AoE slam (if you have summons or allies).
Oversight Protocol — Reveals the top card of the player’s deck, altering its effect negatively.

Quirk:
Takes a deep “breath” before attacks—except it has no lungs.

5. Runeseal Remnant

A floating seal-wheel with rotating rings of copper and gold.
Behavior: Support/annoyance.
Abilities:
Chrono-Rotate — Scrambles the order of cards in the draw pile.
Sealflare — Randomly empowers one of its attacks every few turns.
Lockspin — Disables drawing for 1 turn (rare but powerful).
Quirk:
If you freeze the animation, you can see half-faded imprints of ancient Sealwright hands.

🜂 LOST SCHOLARS (6–10)

Former researchers, archivists, and magi caught in the Shattering.
They are half-mad, half-intact—dangerous without meaning to be.

6. Scholar of the First Error

His face repeats three different expressions, out of sync, as if stuck between timelines.
Behavior: Unstable spellcaster.
Abilities:
Echoed Cast — Spells repeat on the next turn at half strength.
Misaligned Thesis — Applies a debuff where your attack cards may target yourself instead.
Rebound Surge — On receiving damage, releases a pulse of magic at random targets.

Quirk:
Speaks entire sentences in reverse before correcting himself.

7. Archives-Wanderer

Carries the last pages of a treatise that was never finished. The pages burn from the edges inward.
Behavior: Buffs itself; tries to outscale the player.
Abilities:
Accumulated Insight — Gains stacking power each time you draw a card.
Ink Torrent — Deals damage and adds temporary “clutter cards” to your deck.
Final Annotation — Explodes in a parting spell upon death.
Quirk:
Sometimes stops fighting to jot invisible notes in the air.

8. The Broken Lecturer

A transparent silhouette flickering between bodies, endlessly teaching a lesson no one can hear.
Behavior: Excessive debuffing and status manipulation.
Abilities:
Thesis Drain — Reduces your damage and adds a “Confusion” effect.
Inverted Lesson — Flips the effect of your next buff (positive becomes negative).
Lecture Pulse — Low damage AoE that builds over time.
Quirk:
Mouth moves constantly but produces no sound—yet players feel lectured.

9. The Penitent Rewriter

A scholar who tried to “fix” the Law after the Shattering and scarred himself with glyphs.

Behavior: High-risk caster, harms himself with his power.
Abilities:
Correction Strike — Deals large damage but also self-damages.
Revoke Pattern — Removes one of your positive statuses entirely.
Burning Script — A damage-over-time effect that spreads to other enemies if they’re present.

Quirk:
Mutters “still wrong… still wrong…” during every action.

10. The Blind Speculator

Eyes burned out by glimpsing the Entropic Beyond—perhaps the Seer’s dark mirror.
Behavior: Predictive, reactive, punishes certain player choices.
Abilities:
Future Leak — Reveals 2–3 of the player’s upcoming draws.
Speculative Strike — Deals extra damage if the player did not play the predicted card.
Horizon Shriek — A scream that causes random card discards.

Quirk:
Turns its head toward the player despite having no sense of sight.

## BOSSES ##

1. Broken Mandate Boss
✦ The Edict of Silence, “Ostryx the Mute Judge”
Lore

Ostryx was once a high arbiter of Vassara, charged with enforcing the Law through spoken decree.
When the Shattering began, he attempted to shout a stabilizing command.
The breach swallowed his voice — and the Law devoured the rest.
His throat is now a cracked obsidian void, constantly pulling in sound and memory.
He stalks the early Maze as a sentinel of suffocating stillness.

Mechanics

Silence Aura: Cards with verbal-like names (chants, incantations, calls) cost more or lose effects.

Echo Devour: Every 3 turns he “eats” the last card you played, disabling it for the rest of the fight.

Shattered Gavel: Heavy stun attack telegraphed but devastating.

Boss Sprite Prompt

“2D grimdark fantasy boss, tall judge-like construct with cracked obsidian throat forming a black void, heavy law-gavel weapon, robes torn into angular fragments, runes flickering like dying embers, silent aura visually bending sound around him, front view, no background, high-detail game sprite”

2. Shattered Law Boss
✦ The Bifurcated Chancellor, “Velruun of the Two Doctrines”
Lore

Velruun was the scholar who first proposed rewriting the Concordial Law.
During the ritual, he was split — not killed, not duplicated — divided, one body holding two contradictory laws at once.
His halves never sync.
He paces the mid-Maze, surrounded by floating shards containing arguments he made against himself.

Mechanics

Dual Stances:
Left half: defensive buffs, shield mechanics.
Right half: aggression, escalating damage.

He switches stances unpredictably.

Contradiction Pulse: Whenever you play two cards of differing types (Attack/Skill/Spell), he emits a burst of paradox damage.

Boss Sprite Prompt

“2D grimdark fantasy chancellor split vertically into two opposing halves, one glowing blue and ordered, the other red and chaotic, floating law-shards orbiting him, face half-serene half-furious, elegant yet broken scholar robes, front view, high contrast silhouette, no background, game sprite”

3. Grand Contradiction Boss
✦ The Archivist Who Remembers Too Much, “Saruun the Overwritten”
Lore

Saruun catalogued every amendment draft leading to the Grand Revision Ritual.
When the Shattering hit, all those “possible worlds” crushed into him.
He remembers hundreds of versions of himself — all true, all false.
His body flickers between ages, shapes, and roles, trapped between timelines that now bleed into the Maze.

Mechanics

Memory Overload: Randomly replays a card you used earlier in the fight, but twisted.

Forked Reality: Creates two “phantoms” of himself with partial HP; defeating the wrong one buffs him.

Erase & Rewrite: Temporarily turns one of your cards into a “blank clause” that does nothing.

Boss Sprite Prompt

“2D grimdark fantasy boss, shifting archivist with multiple overlapping silhouettes at different ages, spectral faces layered like pages, swirling fragments of alternate selves, robes glitching between styles, law-glyphs orbiting in chaotic loops, front view, clean silhouette despite distortions, no background sprite”

4. Absolute Collapse Boss (Final)
✦ The First Unraveler’s Hand, “The Null Adjudicator”
Lore

This entity is not from Vassara.
It is the first envoy the Unraveler managed to push through the breach — a being shaped like a law-construct but hollow, faceless, and wrong.
Its body is a walking contradiction: symmetrical and asymmetrical at once, always collapsing, always reforming.
It hunts anyone who carries Warrants, drawn to the authority they represent.

Mechanics

Unmaking Aura: Each turn permanently reduces max HP or card potency unless countered by buffs.

Void Rewrite: Random card is inverted (heal becomes harm, block becomes self-damage).

Collapse Spiral: At 50% HP the arena begins folding away, reducing player options round by round.

Boss Sprite Prompt

“2D grimdark fantasy eldritch construct boss, faceless humanoid hollowed out with swirling void inside, limbs folding into impossible angles, symmetrical and broken simultaneously, dripping entropic mist, runes unraveling around its body, front view, sharp silhouette, no background, high-detail sprite”
