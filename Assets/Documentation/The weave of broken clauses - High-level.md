##The weave of broken clauses - High-level

🧭 WHAT THE MAZE IS (In-World)

The Maze is a naturally-occurring fracture-zone where broken pieces of the Concordial Law keep rearranging themselves.
It is alive, constantly trying (and failing) to rewrite itself into order.

The Peacekeepers realized long ago that mortals can move through this space safely if guided by a Warrant. So they use it as:

a trial ground
a source of raw Law-fragments (the currency of power)
a stress test for mortals who can withstand entropy

Its rearranging nature makes it perfect for roguelike structure:
Every entry is a new configuration.

🪢 WHY THE PLAYER GAINS POWER HERE

The Maze is full of:
raw fragments of broken Law
unassigned clauses
echoes of old mandates
concentrated entropic anomalies

By fighting, surviving, and navigating, the player’s Warrants absorb these fragments and stabilize them into upgrades.
This is why the Maze acts like a traditional “Ascendancy” trial—because the Peacekeepers can’t grant power directly anymore.
But the Maze can.
The player proves alignment with the Law under extreme pressure, and their Warrants respond accordingly.

🗺️ MAP DESIGN (12–16 Nodes Per Floor)
Your structure is perfect — a small grid, 12–16 nodes, some branching, some loops.

Key flavor:
“The Maze rearranges itself only between runs, never during one. It honors its own broken rules.”

🧱 ROOM / NODE TYPES

Below are your categories plus new ones that fit your world uniquely.

1. Combat Encounters (Core)

Corrupted beasts, malformed Law-echoes, entropic horrors, or Peacekeeper fragments testing you.

Unique twist:
Sometimes the enemy is a Law construct testing your Warrant alignment.
(E.g. “Clausebound Sentinel” that mirrors one of your Warrant powers.)

2. Treasure Chamber

Chest full of:
Warrant fragments
Embossing materials
Card essences
Sealed clauses
Rare: a full Warrant
Optional flavor trap:
Treasure is safe... but the room collapses behind you.

3. Mazewide Shrine / Buff
Blessings that LAST FOR THE ENTIRE RUN.

Lore examples:
Shrine of Cohesion — your deck draws more consistently; the Maze “likes your intent.”
Shrine of Echoes — cards replay under a Law-echo effect.
Shrine of Anchored Form — enemies deal less entropy-type damage.
Shrine of the Sealwrights — Warrant power increases slightly.

4. Traps / Curses

Not PoE style physical traps; instead:
Entropic anomalies, such as:
Floors that rewrite your hand unless you move perfectly.
Nodes that temporarily disable a Warrant.
Time-bending rooms where you start with fewer cards drawn.
Reality fractures: suffer 1 curse card for next X battles.
These can be avoided with stat checks, skills, special cards, or Warrant traits.

5. Stairs / Next Level
A node that leads down to the next minimap.
When first reached:
The Maze Boss descends to fight you.

🆕 6. New Unique Node Ideas
A. The Clauseforge
A luminous Peacekeeper forge echo. Lets you:
fuse two cards
upgrade a card
emboss a card with a Maze-specific modifier
OR remove a weakness

B. The Convergence Node
Two rooms “collapse” into one:
Fight + reward + random Maze mutation.

C. The Fragment Market

A flickering holographic Peacekeeper vendor.
Only accepts “Law Fragments” earned inside the Maze.
D. The Still-Point Pocket
A tiny stable bubble of normal reality.
Heals you
Removes a debuff

Small story moment (voices from outside the Maze)

E. The Entropic Rift
A dangerous gamble:
Fight mini-elite → reward is massive.
Loss = severe entropy curse for the rest of the run.
F. Law Reconstruction Zone
A glowing area where the Maze is trying to rebuild itself.

You choose:
strengthen enemy encounters in exchange for major boon
weaken enemies but reduce rewards
or stabilize the region (random effect)

👑 THE MAZE BOSS (Identity & Behavior)
What the boss is:

A Law-Warden Echo — an attempt by the Maze to recreate a Peacekeeper, but broken.
It follows the Law too strictly, in impossible, self-contradicting ways.

Examples of names:
The Adjudicator Fragment
The Clauseborn Warden
Echo of the Arbitral Knight
The Lawbound Shade

How it works:
At the end of floor 2, 4, 6, etc.:
Boss appears → player fights → boss retreats at 45% HP.
Why?
Because the Maze is “rewriting” the boss each time — adding new clauses, new contradictions, new powers.

The boss flees deeper because:
“The Law-echo sees you as an unfinished verdict. It must refine itself before delivering judgment.”

On the final floor:
The Maze’s coherence collapses, and the boss cannot rewrite itself anymore, so the player can kill it.

⚔️ BOSS ADD-ON MECHANICS (Random Each Encounter)

Examples:

Mandate Reinforcement: Boss summons Law glyphs you must destroy.
Clause Echo: Boss copies the last card you played.
Entropic Leak: Boss corrupts random cards each turn.
Sealback: Boss gains 1 Warrant-like passive each phase.
Burden of Proof: Certain actions cause backlash damage.
Unwritten Strike: Boss plays a random card from ANY class.
The randomness ensures replay value and explains "fragments rewriting themselves."
